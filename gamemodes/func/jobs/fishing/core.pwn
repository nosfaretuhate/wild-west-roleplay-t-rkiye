/*


you can /fish at any water, we use colandreas to find it
if you're near water, your character wil lrandomly throw the bobber into the water

its randomised
so you can throw it 10 yards into the water
or 12 yards


depending on how deep you throw it
the more chance you have to get good fish
when you get a bite
you gotta spam "Y" until a progress bar is full
then you get the wildlife gui with fish info


Well, to fish you'll need to craft your own rod and upgrade it as you go on using 
the minerals you mined. then you use the farming system to get 1-3 different types 
of bait. And as of now, you will need to get like 150 xp and then once you level up, it's duplicated.

The exp points are calculated this way: length + weight / 2. So you'll always have between 5 and 20 xp.
